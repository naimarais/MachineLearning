Credit Card Fraud Detection using Scikit-Learn and Snap ML
Estimated time needed: 30 minutes

In this exercise session you will consolidate your machine learning (ML) modeling skills by using two popular classification models to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions. These models are: Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine. You will use a real dataset to train each of these models. The dataset includes information about transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. You will use the trained model to assess if a credit card transaction is legitimate or not.

In the current exercise session, you will practice not only the Scikit-Learn Python interface, but also the Python API offered by the Snap Machine Learning (Snap ML) library. Snap ML is a high-performance IBM library for ML modeling. It provides highly-efficient CPU/GPU implementations of linear models and tree-based models. Snap ML not only accelerates ML algorithms through system awareness, but it also offers novel ML algorithms with best-in-class accuracy. For more information, please visit snapml information page.

Introduction

Imagine that you work for a financial institution and part of your job is to build a model that predicts if a credit card transaction is fraudulent or not. You can model the problem as a binary classification problem. A transaction belongs to the positive class (1) if it is a fraud, otherwise it belongs to the negative class (0).

You have access to transactions that occured over a certain period of time. The majority of the transactions are normally legitimate and only a small fraction are non-legitimate. Thus, typically you have access to a dataset that is highly unbalanced. This is also the case of the current dataset: only 492 transactions out of 284,807 are fraudulent (the positive class - the frauds - accounts for 0.172% of all transactions).

To train the model you can use part of the input dataset and the remaining data can be used to assess the quality of the trained model. First, let's download the dataset.

Each row in the dataset represents a credit card transaction. As shown above, each row has 31 variables. One variable (the last variable in the table above) is called Class and represents the target variable. Your objective will be to train a model that uses the other variables to predict the value of the Class variable. Let's first retrieve basic statistics about the target variable.

Note: For confidentiality reasons, the original names of most features are anonymized V1, V2 .. V28. The values of these features are the result of a PCA transformation and are numerical. The feature 'Class' is the target variable and it takes two values: 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise. For more information about the dataset please visit this webpage: https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud.

# get the set of distinct classes
labels = big_raw_data.Class.unique()
​
# get the count of each class
sizes = big_raw_data.Class.value_counts().values
​
# plot the class value counts
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.pie(sizes, labels=labels, autopct='%1.3f%%')
ax.set_title('Target Variable Value Counts')
plt.show()

As shown above, the Class variable has two values: 0 (the credit card transaction is legitimate) and 1 (the credit card transaction is fraudulent). Thus, you need to model a binary classification problem. Moreover, the dataset is highly unbalanced, the target variable classes are not represented equally. This case requires special attention when training or when evaluating the quality of a model. One way of handing this case at train time is to bias the model to pay more attention to the samples in the minority class. The models under the current study will be configured to take into account the class weights of the samples at train/fit time.

Practice
The credit card transactions have different amounts. Could you plot a histogram that shows the distribution of these amounts? What is the range of these amounts (min/max)? Could you print the 90th percentile of the amount values?

# your code here
# we provide our solution here
plt.hist(big_raw_data.Amount.values, 6, histtype='bar', facecolor='g')
plt.show()
​
print("Minimum amount value is ", np.min(big_raw_data.Amount.values))
print("Maximum amount value is ", np.max(big_raw_data.Amount.values))
print("90% of the transactions have an amount less or equal than ", np.percentile(raw_data.Amount.values, 90))

Minimum amount value is  0.0
Maximum amount value is  25691.16
90% of the transactions have an amount less or equal than  203.0
Dataset Preprocessing
In this subsection you will prepare the data for training.

# data preprocessing such as scaling/normalization is typically useful for 
# linear models to accelerate the training convergence
​
# standardize features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance
big_raw_data.iloc[:, 1:30] = StandardScaler().fit_transform(big_raw_data.iloc[:, 1:30])
data_matrix = big_raw_data.values
​
# X: feature matrix (for this analysis, we exclude the Time variable from the dataset)
X = data_matrix[:, 1:30]
​
# y: labels vector
y = data_matrix[:, 30]
​
# data normalization
X = normalize(X, norm="l1")
​
# print the shape of the features matrix and the labels vector
print('X.shape=', X.shape, 'y.shape=', y.shape)
X.shape= (2848070, 29) y.shape= (2848070,)
Dataset Train/Test Split
Now that the dataset is ready for building the classification models, you need to first divide the pre-processed dataset into a subset to be used for training the model (the train set) and a subset to be used for evaluating the quality of the model (the test set).

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42, stratify=y)       
print('X_train.shape=', X_train.shape, 'Y_train.shape=', y_train.shape)
print('X_test.shape=', X_test.shape, 'Y_test.shape=', y_test.shape)
X_train.shape= (1993649, 29) Y_train.shape= (1993649,)
X_test.shape= (854421, 29) Y_test.shape= (854421,)

As shown above both SVM models provide the same score on the test dataset. However, as in the case of decision trees, Snap ML runs the training routine faster than Scikit-Learn.

Moreover, as shown above, not only is Snap ML seemlessly accelerating scikit-learn applications, but the library's Python API is also compatible with scikit-learn metrics and data preprocessors.

Practice
In this section you will evaluate the quality of the SVM models trained above using the hinge loss metric (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.hinge_loss.html). Run inference on the test set using both Scikit-Learn and Snap ML models. Compute the hinge loss metric for both sets of predictions. Print the hinge losses of Scikit-Learn and Snap ML.

# your code goes here






# get the confidence scores for the test samples
sklearn_pred = sklearn_svm.decision_function(X_test)
snapml_pred  = snapml_svm.decision_function(X_test)
​
# import the hinge_loss metric from scikit-learn
from sklearn.metrics import hinge_loss
​
# evaluate the hinge loss from the predictions
loss_snapml = hinge_loss(y_test, snapml_pred)
print("[Snap ML] Hinge loss:   {0:.3f}".format(loss_snapml))
​
# evaluate the hinge loss metric from the predictions
loss_sklearn = hinge_loss(y_test, sklearn_pred)
print("[Scikit-Learn] Hinge loss:   {0:.3f}".format(loss_snapml))
​
# the two models should give the same Hinge loss
[Snap ML] Hinge loss:   0.228
[Scikit-Learn] Hinge loss:   0.228
